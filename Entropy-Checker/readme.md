# üîç Entropy Scanner for EXE/DLL Files

A lightweight PowerShell script to scan `.exe` and `.dll` files for entropy, helping identify packed or obfuscated binaries. Supports scanning individual files or entire directories (recursively).

## üöÄ Features

- Calculates file entropy (useful for malware/packer detection)
- Scans all `.exe` and `.dll` files in a folder
- Skips large files (>100MB) to avoid freezing
- Displays clean tabular output
- Shows real-time progress during directory scan

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### üî∏ Scan a single file
```powershell
& "entropy.ps1" -File "C:\Path\to\file.dll"
```

C:\Test\huge.exe                         Skipped (>120.5MB)
```
