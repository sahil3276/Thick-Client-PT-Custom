# Thick Client Pentesting Helper Scripts

This repository contains custom scripts developed by me for Thick Client (Desktop-based) Penetration Testing.

These tools are designed to aid during internal assessments within an organization (ORG) as well as during external pentests. The scripts streamline certain tasks that are commonly encountered while testing thick client applications.
If you're involved in thick client security assessments, feel free to use or adapt these scripts to suit your workflow.
